DON'T Change CURRENT FILES. ONLY RENAME, MOVE and COMMIT

1. Change names for claude.md, plan.md and prompt.md into uppercase. architecture.md and diagrams.md need to stay lowercase.
2. In folder docs careate seperate folders for technical documentation from ai documentation
3. the move diagrams.md and architecture.md into documentation and rest into ai related file
4. Add current version of .gitignore into a commit (if you feel that .gitignore is lacking something you can update it)
5. Add and commit these changes on github
